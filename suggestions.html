            <li><h2>Make the site more clear for new users</h2>
                <p>The website is geared towards returning comic book readers with the homepage being the most recently posted comic. This makes sense as most visitors will be return readers looking for the lastest page, but durin our usability test our new potential readers had no idea what the site was, its purpose or who Dr. McNinja, the main character, was.</p><p>Currently the only way to find out about the comic, and land on a page specifically designed to introduce new readers to the series can only be reached by clicking the character in the top right. Adding a small link or bit of text such as "<a href ="http://drmcninja.com/newreaders.php">New here? Click the ninja or this link.</a>" in the green area labelled #1 on the picture.</p>

            <li><h2>Shop should not get adBlocked</h2></li>
            <li><h2>Generally Reorganize and declutter Sidebar</h2></li>
            <li><h2>Make navigation of the comic books more intuitive, page number dropdown labelled, comics numbered maybe?</h2></li>
