                <h2>Make the site more clear for new users</h2>
                <p>The website is geared towards returning comic book readers with the homepage being the most recently posted comic. This makes sense as most visitors will be return readers looking for the lastest page, but durin our usability test our new potential readers had no idea what the site was, its purpose or who Dr. McNinja, the main character, was.</p>
                <p>Currently the only way to find out about the comic, and land on a page specifically designed to introduce new readers to the series can only be reached by clicking the character in the top right. Adding a small link or bit of text such as "<a href ="http://drmcninja.com/newreaders.php">New here? Click the ninja or this link.</a>" in the green area labelled #1 on the picture could clear a lot of this mystery up.</p>

                <h2>Make the header more readable in general</h2>
                <p>The header/banner at the top of the screen (outlined with black) is themed and very artsy but its too cluttered for users to quickly decipher. It's location, seperated from the left side and more centered made on tester initially think it was an ad.</p><p>To resolve this the Name of the site should be styled more prominently and moved towards the top-left corner while other text and images in the banner are seperated from it. The rest of the themed banner looks good though and is funny context for the update info for the comic.</p>

                <h2>Shop should not get adBlocked</h2>
                <span class = "imgWrap">
                    <img id = "abp0" class = "abp" src ="adblock_off.png" alt = "image of the shop link">
                </span>
                <span class = "imgWrap">
                    <img id = "abp1" class = "abp" src ="adblock_on.png" alt = "image of the lack of shop links with adblock on">
                </span>
                <span class = "imgWrap">
                    <img id = "adCode0" class = "adCode" src ="adCode.png" alt = "the code causing this issue">
                </span>
                <p>In the image on the far left the site as it is intended to appear. The image on the closer left shows the website when a browser connects to it using AdBlock Plus. The reason that this happens is the way the shop links are implemented. Even though it's for this site's shop the shop links are formatted as ad objects from the wwebsite which hosts the shop. Adbloc see's the word ad and removes it. This is extremely counterproductive for the author because not only does Mr. Hastings lose ad revenue on ABP users he also loses them as potential customers at his shop which they no longer have links to. This problem would need to be resolved by working with the shop hoster, Topataco, and Mr. Hastings himself to change the way these links appear on the site </p>
